Darunavir structure from PDB 6DH0 was optimized in Gaussian using
HF/6-31(d)G theory. The partial charges were fit using the am1-bcc charge
model in antechamber. Atom types were assigned based on GAFF2 equilibrium
mesurements and the carbon atoms in the bis-THF were manually assigned to 
c3 instead of c5.
